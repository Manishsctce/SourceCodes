/* INTERFACE
 * Interface class hv only public and abstract modifier; not static, final
 * variables are by default public, static and final and it must be initialize
 *  interface method cannot be static and Final
 *  
 *  we can define a class inside the interface. 
 *  use of inner class in interface is, we can write default implementation for interface methods.
 *  we can bind the nested class of interface to our class. So we didnt need to implement interface methods in our class
 *  
 *   we can mention throws Exception in our method signature
